I Was Made For Loving You	"Mmm, yeah!
 Tonight, I want to give it all to you
 In the darkness, there's so much I want to do
 And tonight, I want to lay it at your feet
 'Cause girl, I was made for you
 And girl, you were made for me
 I was made for lovin' you, baby
 You were made for lovin' me
 And I can't get enough of you, baby
 Can you get enough of me?
 Tonight, I want to see it in your eyes
 Feel the magic, there's something that drives me wild
 And tonight, we're gonna make it all come true
 'Cause girl, you were made for me
 And girl, I was made for you
 I was made for lovin' you, baby
 You were made for lovin' me
 And I can't get enough of you, baby
 Can you get enough of me?
 I was made for lovin' you, baby
 You were made for lovin' me
 And I can give it all to you, baby
 Can you give it all to me?
 Oh, can't get enough
 I can't get enough
 I can't get enough
 I was made for lovin' you, baby
 You were made for lovin' me
 And I can't get enough of you, baby
 Can you get enough of me?
 Oh, I was made
 You were made
 I can't get enough
 No, I can't get enough
 I was made for lovin' you, baby
 You were made for lovin' me
 And I can't get enough of you, baby
 Can you get enough of me?

Africa	"I hear the drums echoing tonight
 But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
 She's coming in, 12:30 flight
 The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
 I stopped an old man along the way
 Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
 He turned to me as if to say
 ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)
 The wild dogs cry out in the night
 As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
 I know that I must do what's right
 As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
 I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)
 Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 (I bless the rain)
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 I bless the rains down in Africa
 (Gonna take the time)
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)

Bitter Sweet Symphony	"'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life
 Tryna make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
 I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
 You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
 No change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 But I'm here in my mold
 I am here in my mold
 But I'm a million different people
 From one day to the next
 I can't change my mold
 No, no, no, no, no
 (Have you ever been down?)
 Well, I've never prayed but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
 I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
 I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
 But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singin' to me now
 No change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 But I'm here in my mold
 I am here in my mold
 And I'm a million different people
 From one day to the next
 I can't change my mold
 No, no, no, no, no
 (Have you ever been down?)
 I can't change, oh, no
 I can't change, oh
 'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life
 Tryna make ends meet, tryna find somebody then you die
 I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
 You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
 You know I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 But I'm here in my mold
 I am here in my mold
 And I'm a million different people
 From one day to the next
 I can't change my mold
 No, no, no, no, no
 I can't change my mold
 No, no, no, no, no,
 I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no
 It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
 It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
 I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
 I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
 Been down
 Ever been down
 Ever been down
 Ever been down
 Ever been down
 Have you ever been down?
 Have you ever been down?
 Have you ever been down?

Wishlist	"I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off
 I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on
 I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on
 The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top
 
 I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
 For fifty million hands upraised and open toward the sky
 
 I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me
 I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me
 
 I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good
 I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood
 
 I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun
 I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
 
 I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on
 I wish I was the verb to trust and never let you down
 
 I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up"
We Are All Made Of Stars	"Growing in numbers
 Growing in speed
 Can't fight the future
 Can't fight what I see
 
 People they come together
 People they fall apart
 No one can stop us now
 Cause we are all made of stars
 
 Efforts of lovers
 Left in my mind
 I sing in the reaches
 We'll see what we find
 
 People they come together
 People they fall apart
 No one can stop us now
 Cause we are all made of stars
 People they come together
 People they fall apart
 No one can stop us now
 Cause we are all made of stars
 
 Slow slow slow, come come
 Someone come come come
 Someone's come come
 Someone's come
 Even love is going round
 You can't ignore what is going 'round
 You can't ignore what is going 'round
 You can't ignore what is going 'round
 
 Slowly rebuilding
 I feel it in me
 Growing in numbers
 Growing in peace
 
 People they come together
 People they fall apart
 No one can stop us now
 Cause we are all made of stars
 People they come together
 People they fall apart
 No one can stop us now
 Cause we are all made of stars
 People they come together
 (People they come together)
 People they fall apart
 (People they fall apart)
 No one can stop us now
 (No one can stop us now)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (We are all made of stars)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (People they come together)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (People they fall apart)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (No one can stop us now)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (We are all made of stars)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (People they come together)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (People they fall apart)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (No one can stop us now)
 Cause we are all made of stars
 (We are all made of stars)
 
 Cause we are all made, cause we are all made
 (People they come together)
 Cause we are all made, cause we are all made
 (People they come together)
 Cause we are all made, cause we are all made
 (People they come together)"
Everything I Do I Do It For You	"Look into my eyes
 You will see, what you mean to me
 Search your heart, search your soul
 When you find me there, you'll search no more
 Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
 You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
 You know it's true (you know it's true)
 Everything I do
 I do it for you
 Yeah, yeah
 Look in to your heart, you will find
 There is nothing there to hide
 Take me as I am, take my life
 I would give it all, I would sacrifice
 Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
 I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
 You know it's true
 Everything I do
 I do it for you
 There's no love, like your love
 And no other, could give me more love
 There's nowhere, unless you're there
 All the time, all the way
 You can't tell me it's not worth trying for
 Just can't help it, there's nothing I want more
 Oh, I would fight for you, yeah, I'd lie for you
 Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you
 You know it's true
 Everything I do
 I do for you
