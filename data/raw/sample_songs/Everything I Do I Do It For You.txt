Look into my eyes
You will see, what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
When you find me there, you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
You know it's true (you know it's true)
Everything I do
I do it for you
Yeah, yeah
Look in to your heart, you will find
There is nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
There's no love, like your love
And no other, could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way
You can't tell me it's not worth trying for
Just can't help it, there's nothing I want more
Oh, I would fight for you, yeah, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do for you
